## Why this project exists

If you do any front-end work you already know HTML + CSS + JS, and you've probably wished you could just *use* that to make slides instead of fighting a WYSIWYG tool. GeekPresent lets you do exactly that — and takes care of the tedious parts:

- **No manual paging or navigation.** List your slides once in `pages.ts`; arrow keys, the on-screen nav bar, and the Table of Contents are wired up for you.
- **Fixed canvas, automatic scaling.** You design on a fixed **1280×720** canvas and position things with normal CSS — including absolute positioning at exact pixels — and the framework scales the whole slide to fit any screen. You think in one size; it handles the rest.
- **Colocation, your choice.** Global CSS/JS/assets work, but each page can also keep its *own* assets (images, etc.) right next to it. Pick whatever keeps cognitive load low.
- **Real componentization.** Svelte is excellent at components, so reusable slide pieces (boxes, code viewers, notes…) are just imports.
- **Navigation built in.** Arrow keys, on-screen buttons, and a Table of Contents — no wiring required.
- **SCALED / FIXED modes.** Present scaled-to-fit, or switch to a fixed 1280×720 view with speaker notes visible below.
- **It's just text.** Slides are Svelte files, so they diff cleanly, version-control nicely, and hot-reload while you edit.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5173/slides/title.html
```

```bash
pnpm build      # static site -> ../docs/
pnpm preview    # preview the build
pnpm deploy     # publish ../docs to GitHub Pages
```

## How to use

### Slides: define the order, then add files

List your slides, in order, in the presentation's `pages.ts` (`src/routes/slides/pages.ts`):

```ts
export const pages = [
    { path: "title.html", title: "Title" },
    { path: "intro.html", title: "Introduction" },
    { path: "demo.html",  title: "Demo" },
];
```

Each entry is a folder under `src/routes/slides/<name>.html/` with two files:

```
src/routes/slides/intro.html/
  +layout.js      # export const prerender = true; export const trailingSlash = "never";
  +page.svelte    # your slide content
```

> **Multiple presentations:** `slides/` is just one presentation — its route folder. To add another, create a
> sibling folder (e.g. `src/routes/talk2/`) with its own `pages.ts`, `+layout.svelte`, and slides.
> Navigation and the Table of Contents are scoped per presentation, and each presentation can have its **own
> theme** (fonts, colours, background image, favicon) in its `+layout.svelte`. See the `demo/` presentation
> (`/demo/title.html`) for a fully independent, differently-themed example.

### Title and content pages

Two templates cover most slides.

**TitlePage** — for title slides and section dividers; three named slots:

```svelte
<script>
  import TitlePage from '$lib/templates/TitlePage.svelte';
</script>

<TitlePage>
  <span slot="title">GeekPresent</span>
  <span slot="subtitle">How to Build Presentations</span>
  <span slot="subsubtitle">Your Name</span>
</TitlePage>
```

**ContentPage** — for everything else; `title` + `subtitle` props and a default slot:

```svelte
<script>
  import ContentPage from '$lib/templates/ContentPage.svelte';
</script>

<ContentPage title="Introduction" subtitle="What we'll cover">
  <ul>
    <li>First point</li>
    <li>Second point</li>
  </ul>
</ContentPage>
```

Both templates add the navigation bar automatically.

### Positioning & size

Every slide lives on a fixed **1280×720** canvas. Lay out with whatever CSS suits the slide:

- **Normal flow** — `ContentPage` centers your content; just write HTML.
- **Absolute positioning** — when you want pixel-precise placement, position elements absolutely within the 1280×720 canvas. Because the size is fixed, `left: 640px` means the same thing on every screen.

You never write scaling code: in **SCALED** mode the framework transforms the whole canvas to fit the window (keeping the 16:9 ratio); in **FIXED** mode it stays exactly 1280×720.

### Interactivity (it's just Svelte)

Slides are Svelte components, so state and events work as usual — perfect for click-to-reveal, toggles, or anything interactive:

```svelte
<script>
  import Box from '$lib/components/Box.svelte';
  let show = false;
</script>

<button on:click={() => show = true}>Show the answer</button>

<Box bind:expanded={show} width={600} height={400}>
  <img src="answer.png" alt="the answer" />
</Box>
```

### Box — expandable overlay

`Box` pops its content up as a dimmed overlay. It opens when you set `expanded`, and closes on **CLOSE**, a click **outside**, or **Escape** — clicks *inside* are left alone, so the content stays interactive (e.g. selecting text).

```svelte
<Box bind:expanded={show} width={600} height={400}>
  <!-- any HTML or components -->
</Box>
```

Common props: `width`, `height`, `expanded`, `showClose`, `scrollable`, `top` / `left` / `bottom` / `right` (custom position), `shadowOpacity`.

### Code

Read-only code viewers built on the Monaco editor:

```svelte
<script>
  import Code    from '$lib/components/Code.svelte';
  import CodeBox from '$lib/components/CodeBox.svelte';
  let show = false;
</script>

<!-- inline, any language -->
<Code code={src} language="python" width="900px" height="300px" />

<!-- pop-up overlay, with an optional title bar -->
<CodeBox code={src} language="python" title="solution.py" bind:expanded={show} />
```

- `Code` / `CodeBox` — any language (via `language`), using Monaco's built-in folding.
- `JavaCode` / `JavaCodeBox` — Java-specialized, with a custom `import`/brace folding provider.

> Monaco is loaded from a CDN, so the code components need an internet connection.

### Local assets

Keep a page's images next to its `+page.svelte` and `import` them — Vite bundles each one and hands you its URL:

```svelte
<script>
  import diagram from './diagram.png';
</script>

<img src={diagram} alt="diagram" />
```

(`static/` is still there for truly site-wide files.)

There's also a helper that fetches a YouTube thumbnail and generates a QR code straight into a page folder:

```bash
cd src/routes/slides/my-slide.html
../../../../utils/prepare-youtube.sh https://youtu.be/<id> . my-video
```

then feed them to the `YouTube` component (which shows the thumbnail with a QR overlay that links to the video):

```svelte
<script>
  import YouTube   from '$lib/components/YouTube.svelte';
  import thumbnail from './my-video-TN.png';
  import qr        from './my-video-QR.png';
</script>

<YouTube {thumbnail} {qr} alt="My talk" youtubeId="<id>" />
```

### Other components

The presentation under `src/routes/slides/` is itself a working reference — open any slide and read its source. Beyond the above you'll find **Note** (speaker notes), **Hint** (bottom-of-slide cue), **Label** (hoverable inline highlight), **WideDiv** (wheel-scrollable wide container), and **Copyright** (auto-added corner notice).

## Display modes & speaker notes

Toggle **SCALED / FIXED** in the top-right corner:

- **SCALED** — the slide scales to fit the window. Use this to present.
- **FIXED** — the slide stays at 1280×720 and **speaker notes** become visible below it.

Add notes with the `Note` component (hidden in SCALED mode and when printing):

```svelte
<script>
  import Note from '$lib/components/Note.svelte';
</script>

<Note><p>Remember to mention X.</p></Note>
```

## Navigation & keyboard shortcuts

The nav bar (FIRST / PREV / NEXT / LAST) and the **Table of Contents** (top-left button) are added to every slide automatically.

| Key         | Action          |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Arrow Left  | Previous slide  |
| Arrow Right | Next slide      |
| Escape      | Close ToC / Box |

## Printing

The presentation is print-friendly — the navigation, Table of Contents, and mode toggle are hidden under `@media print`. Use your browser's print (Ctrl/Cmd-P) to print or export to PDF.

## Text view (long-form)

Alongside slides, GeekPresent builds a second artifact type — a **Text**: *one long page* (fluid width that follows the window, capped at 1080px; height grows with the content) that you author by hand and scroll, reusing the same components. It's the read-at-your-own-pace counterpart to a deck.

- The site's **landing page** (`/`) and the sample at **`/text.html`** are Text artifacts — see `src/routes/(home)/` and `src/routes/text.html/`.
- The Table of Contents' "View as article" link opens `/text.html`.
- A Text renders the same components but in a flowing document; the on-slide navigation bar becomes a single **TOP** button. To start your own, copy the `src/routes/text.html/` route folder.

## Building & deploying to GitHub Pages

It's a fully static site (`@sveltejs/adapter-static`, every route prerendered):

```bash
pnpm build      # outputs the static site to ../docs/
pnpm deploy     # publishes ../docs to GitHub Pages (via gh-pages)
```

The build writes to `../docs/`; `static/.nojekyll` ensures GitHub Pages serves SvelteKit's `_app/` directory (files starting with `_`) correctly.
